# WanderLust

WanderLust is a full-stack web application project created to demonstrate web development skills. Inspired by Airbnb, this fictional platform allows users to browse, create, update, and delete listings for vacation homes, as well as add reviews. It serves as a portfolio project showcasing the implementation of CRUD operations, RESTful APIs, and MVC architecture.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Listings:** Users can explore, create, edit, and delete vacation rental listings, each with detailed descriptions, images, pricing, and geolocation data. Listings support multiple categories for better organization.
- **Interactive Reviews:** Guests can leave ratings and feedback on listings, helping others make informed decisions.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Search listings by title or location, filter by country, and browse by categories such as Trending, Rooms, Mountains, and more.
- **User Authentication:** Secure signup and login functionality to protect user data and personalize experiences.
- **Responsive Design with Dark Mode:** Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices, with a toggle for dark mode to enhance user experience.
- **Interactive Maps:** Integrated MapTiler maps display listing locations with markers and popups.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Toggle between base prices and prices including taxes for transparent cost display.
- **Robust Validation & Error Handling:** All user input is validated and errors are managed gracefully for a smooth experience.
- **GeoJSON Support:** Listing locations are stored using a geometry key, compatible with mapping and geospatial features.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** EJS templating, Bootstrap 5, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MapTiler SDK for maps
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js for authentication
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Other:** Joi for validation, Multer for file uploads, custom error handling utilities

## Getting Started

1. **Install Node.js and MongoDB** on your system.
2. **Clone the repository** and install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. **Seed the database** with sample data for instant exploration.
4. **Start the application** and visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Folder Structure

- `init/` – Database seeding scripts and sample data
- `models/` – Mongoose schemas for listings, reviews, and users
- `public/` – Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- `routes/` – Express route handlers for all resources
- `views/` – EJS templates for all pages and components
- `utils/` – Utility modules for error handling and async operations
- `app.js` – Main application entry point
